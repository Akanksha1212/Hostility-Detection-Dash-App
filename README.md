For further development, simply activate the existing virtual environment.

    source venv/bin/activate


## Usage

Run the file `app.py` and then enter a sentence, choose a type of classifier and click on the button `Explain results`. We can then observe the features (i.e. words or tokens) that contributed to the classifier predicting a particular class label.
